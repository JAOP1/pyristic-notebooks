# pyristic-notebooks
The following notebooks helps you to have a better understanding of how you can implement every metaheuristic available in pyristic. To start the learning process you should first install pyristic as follow:

1. We suggest to you create a controlled environment, using [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html). After you have obtained anaconda,create a environment as follow:

```bash
conda create --name pyristic_test
```

2. Activate the environment, when the environment is active, you  should see at the beginning the tag pyristic_test in your command line:
```bash
conda activate pyristic_test
```

If you have any issues, please check if you have the environment:
```bash
conda env list
```

3. Finally, install pyristic and that's it!
```bash
pip install pyristic
```

# Examples
The algorithms are inside of the examples folder, the include has anything else to the notebooks (images).
